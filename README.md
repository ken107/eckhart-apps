# What Is It?

I wanted to listen to Eckhart Tolle's videos on my Amazon Echo at home and on my Samsung Gear S2 while on the go.  The ETNow website can be viewed on desktop and mobile, but I had stopped using a smartphone since last year, and having the computer turned on isn't convenient.  Hence these apps.

A server is required.  The node.js service scrapes the ETNow website and exposes a REST API for listing and downloading videos.  Downloaded videos are saved on the server.
