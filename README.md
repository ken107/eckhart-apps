# What Is It?

I need to listen to Eckhart Tolle's videos on my Samsung Gear S2, and on my Amazon Echo when I'm at home.  The ETNow website can be viewed on desktop and mobile, but I had stopped using a smartphone since a year ago, and having the computer turned on isn't convenient.  Hence these apps.

A server is required.  The node.js server scrapes the ETNow website and exposes a REST API for listing and downloading videos.  It also caches the videos locally.  ETNow login credentials are required.
